# 🔗 Data Source & Integration  

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**.  
To streamline the process, a small **Python script** was used to fetch the dataset via the Kaggle API and save it into a local folder. Power BI was then connected to this folder, ensuring that whenever the script is re-run, the dashboard can refresh automatically with the updated data.  

## ✅ Benefits of This Setup  

- **Automation:** Eliminated manual file downloads  
- **Consistency:** One source of truth for data  
- **Scalability:** Can be extended to other datasets in future
